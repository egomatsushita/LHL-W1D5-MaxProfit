   - create a function maxProfit
   - should return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying a stock
     at the given price and then selling the stock later on.
   - eg: [45, 24, 35, 31, 40, 38, 11]
   - return 16 (because bought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, a profit of $16).
   - if no profit could have been made, return -1.
